# campus_connect
"Campus Connect" is a web application designed to aggregate college events from various college websites into a single platform. 
The application uses web scraping techniques to collect event data from different college sites and then displays this information in a user-friendly format on our website. 
The project aims to make it easier for students to find and stay updated on college events from multiple institutions in one place.
